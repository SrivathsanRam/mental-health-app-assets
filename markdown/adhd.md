### What is ADHD

ADHD is one of the more common types of neurodevelopmental disorder. If you have ADHD, you may notice difficulties in regulating your everyday behaviour/ reactions to that appropriate of your age that frequently persists through adolescence into adult years. It can be related but not limited to inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity which is caused by dysregulation of your brain’s prefrontal cortex that governs your logical thinking and self-control of impulses. 

The combination of symptoms at the point of time of assessment determine your ADHD presentation - Predominantly Inattentive/ Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive/ Combined. A diagnosis is given by a psychiatrist if you exhibit: 

- Several hyperactive-impulsive or inattentive symptoms before the age of 12 
- Several symptoms present in at least two settings such as school and home 
- Symptoms are disrupting and interfering with your ability to function in social, school or work setting 

Some of the symptoms are:

| __Inattention Type__                                       | __Hyperactive-Impulsive Type__              |

<ins>Causes of ADHD</ins>

The causes are not fully understood yet but studies and researchers have found increase risk for the following factors: 

1. __Genetics__
    + If one parent has ADHD, the child is 50% more likely to have ADHD as well, there is a higher probability if both parents have the condition  

2. __Prenatal and premature pregnancy factors__
    + Difficulties during pregnancy or/and premature birth increases the probability of ADHD  
    + Low birth weight 
    + Pre-birth exposure to alcohol, nicotine and lead 

3. Medical Conditions 
    + Brain injuries such as stroke, concussions and brain tumour 

<ins>Treatment for ADHD</ins>

At present, no treatments have been found to cure this disorder, but many treatments exist to effectively manage and ease the symptoms. 

1. __ADHD Medication__
  There are two types of ADHD medications, stimulants and non-stimulants.
  
    + Stimulants are often the first line of medications due to the higher effectiveness for most ADHD individuals. They can come in short-acting (instant release), intermediate-acting, and long-acting forms and can be classified under two categories - Methylphenidate-based or Amphetamine-based. 
        
        Some commonly prescribed stimulant medications
        + Ritalin [Methylphenidate-based]
        + Concerta [Methylphenidate-based]
        + Adderall [Amphetamine-based]
        + Vyvanse [Amphetamine-based]
    + Non-stimulants will be used if individuals do not respond well to simulants. Common prescriptions are: 
        + Strattera 
        + Guanfacine

### ADHD and the Army

Given the difficulties with inattention/hyperactivity-impulsiveness (depending on how severe it is), you will likely find yourself “bonding” with Sergeant Major over extra duties or “counselling”. The following scenarios could be familiar to you:

- __Poor impulse control leading to unwise and impulsive decisions being made__ e.g.,  
  - Going to certain areas because of curiosity despite being warned not to 
  - Choosing to take the more “fun/convenient” way instead of the safe way 

- __Poor sustained attention or persistence of effort to tasks__ e.g.,  
  - Breaking away from given tasks frequently to engage in game/play and taking longer than needed to complete the assignment 
  - Making a lot of careless mistakes especially when engaged in protracted, tedious and unstimulating task. 

- __Not remembering to do things/ unconsciously act without hindsight or forethought.__ 
  - Unintended forgetfulness resulting in frequent lateness  
  - Making assumptions that are often wrong in turn deviated from what was instructed. 

__If you have or believe you have ADHD and it is severely impacting your life, do seek professional help as soon you can! :\) Remember given the right treatment, these problems can be managed to help you go through your NS life smoothly!__
