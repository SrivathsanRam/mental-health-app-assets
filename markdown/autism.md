### What is ASD

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that typically appear in the first 2 years of your life and last through your lifetime. Being a spectrum type of disorder, there is a wide range in the type and severity of symptoms. People with ASD are known to have more challenges with social interactions, communications and also exhibit restrictive or repetitive behaviours/ interests, which can cause some dysfunction in their school, work or other aspects of life. As such, clinician diagnoses ASD based on the presence of such behaviours through your developmental years. 

__The two core autism symptoms are:__ 
  - Challenges with social communication and interaction skills __and__ 
  - Restricted and repetitive behaviours  

| Social communication and interaction skills  | Restricted and repetitive behaviours  |

Eye contact can be uncomfortable for some autistic people, and you may notice them avoiding your gaze but that doesn’t mean they aren’t paying attention!

While autistic people may have difficulty expressing emotions and lack social skills, in turn avoid interaction, it doesn’t mean they don’t have feelings or do not want to connect with you! They may just not know how. Do give them a little more patience when getting to know them. 

### __Causes of ASD__

There are many contributing factors that can increase the risk of developing ASD but are not direct causes such as a combination of the following:  

1. __Genetic influences__
    + If one child has ASD, there is a 20% greater risk of the next child developing autism 
    + Existing genetic syndromes e.g., 1 in 3 people with Fragile X syndrome have ASD 

2. __Environmental factors__
    + Parents giving birth in their later years in life. 
    + Prenatal exposure to air pollution or certain pesticides 
    + Pre-birth exposure to harmful chemicals 
    + Maternal obesity, diabetes or immune system disorders 
    + Prematurity (before 37 weeks) or very low birth weight

### Treatment for ASD 

Depending on the ability and severity of the symptoms, skills that are lacking can be learnt and strengths built given early intervention. Working closely with a consistent mental health care provider will help you find the right combination of treatment over time. Some treatment methods are: 

1. Behaviour and communication therapies 
    + Reduce certain disruptive behaviours 
    + Introduce skills that can benefit your knowledge of social cues and emotional expression 

2. Educational therapies  
    + Provide highly structured and individualised educational programs that help you excel in your chosen field 

3. Medications 
    + No medications can cure the core symptoms of autism but specific medications can help control or ease symptoms relating to ASD e.g., anxiety 

### ASD and the Army 

The Army being a highly corroborative and teamplay environment requires can be very daunting in terms of social interaction and being adaptive to different ways of doing things. Guidance is often needed to help ASD change their set routine, which can be very uncomfortable to them.   

On the flip side, some of the symptoms of Autistic people can be a strength. For instance, being able to go deep into their interests meant they excel in learning the details and typically remember what they learnt for long period of time. This makes them great subject-matter-experts (SME) in their chosen field.  
 
They also tend to be strong visual and auditory learners, excelling in topics like math, science, computing, programming, music or art. Matching them to the right type of work nature can help them derive more meaningful serving with less adjustment issues.

### TL:DR

Autism Spectrum Disorder is a type of lifelong neurodevelopmental condition that can be detected in early childhood. Based on the World Health Organisation, about 1 in 100 children have autism. Characteristics differ across individuals but generally causea difficulties in social interaction and communication, in turn challenges in school, work and otherw aspects of life. Early and proper treatment can help autistic people build the relevant skills to lead a more positive life.
