### WHAT IS IT

Mindful pauses are brief, intentional and conscious moments where we step back from the rush to reconnect with ourselves and our surroundings. They're like small pockets of calm amidst the chaos, allowing us to ground ourselves in the present moment. There are multiple benefits to mindful pauses such as:  

__Stress Reduction__: Taking mindful pauses can help alleviate stress and anxiety, allowing us to re-evaluate where we are in our pursue and approach challenges with a clearer mind. 

__Increased Productivity__: Paradoxically, taking breaks can boost productivity. Mindful pauses provide an opportunity to recharge and rejuvenate, allowing us to return to our tasks with renewed focus and energy. 

__Enhanced Well-being__: By giving ourselves chance to pause and breathe, we allow mental, emotional, and physical recovery to take place.  

One of the easiest mindful pauses is moderating our breathing. When we are stressed, our nervous system acts up to activate the fight-flight response. Our breathing quickens to take in more air to fuel our body into action. However, long engagement in such tense mode wears down our body akin like an over-drive engine. Slowing our breathing pace sends signal to our body that all is ok, in turn help us calm down. 

### HOW TO APPLY IT

There are many ways to integrate mindful pauses in our daily activities, ranging from walks, looking at the sky, eating etc. The key lies in savouring the moment of the activity and not multi-task.

__Start Micro__: Begin by integrating short mindful pauses into your daily routine. Whether it's taking a few deep breaths before starting a new task or enjoying a cup of tea without distraction, every moment counts. 

__Set Reminders to be Consistent__: With so many priorities in life, it's easy to de-prioritise breaks. Set gentle reminders to regularly prompt yourself to take pauses. Schedule routine self-care time to unwind from the busyness of your work. The more you practise and engage in mindful pauses, the easier it is to activate it in times of need to help us gain back control of our stress. 

__Find What Works for You__: There's no one-size-fits-all approach to what a good break is. Experiment with different techniques of breathing, or combinations of factors to build your optimal pause environment or simply just start observing your surroundings to break your rushing thoughts. You can also explore different activities to find one that interests you. Discover what resonates with you and build your own self-care board, like the one below! 

__Embrace Imperfection__: Remember, the goal of mindful pauses isn't perfection but presence. It's okay if your mind wanders or if you struggle to fully quiet your thoughts. The act of simply noticing and returning to the present moment is what matters most.
