### TL:DR

When we experience intense emotions, it can be difficult to make sense of them or even express them in words for others to understand or help us. While we are not defined by the emotions we feel, they do affect our life in various ways.  Being emotionally aware redirects our focus from just feeling it to identifying what we can do about it. 

Let’s use this feeling wheel developed by Dr Gloria Wilcox to explore, identify, express and regulate our emotions. Improve our emotional intelligence through reflecting and accepting our emotional experience.

### What is it

Do you know that there are more than 20 distinct emotions that a person can experience, not to mention the various combinations of emotions that can occur in just a single episode. 

It is no wonder that it can be challenging to navigate our emotions and at times get lost in them. Especially when we experience intense emotions that cloud our mind, in turn activates our “fight-flight-freeze-fawn” stress response. 

Emotions can influence our actions in 5 main ways:
1. Subjective Feeling – just simply experiencing the emotion and reflecting on our inner world to recognise the experience at that point in time.
2. Action Tendency Component – where the identified emotion moves our body into the relevant action e.g., fear (emotion) can stop us from touching a boiling pot of water (action).
3. Appraisal Component – where we learn about what triggers the emotion we felt and track how they can affect our well-being. It can then help us communicate our emotions better to people around us.
4. Motor Component – this refers to the ways of expressing our emotions e.g., facial expression, hand gesture, body movement etc.
5. Physiological Component – this is the biological reaction that our body will go through for the said emotion e.g., rushing blood flow to the hands when we are angry “

| Subjective Feeling | Action Tendency Component | Appraisal Component                          | Motor Component                                        | Physiological Component  |
|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| I am afraid        | I don’t want to be here   | I am not prepared; I don’t have enough time  | Observable signs: frowning, worried face, restlessness | I feel jittery           |

We all posses the above 5 components, but the intensity and expression of the same emotion can differ among individual, depending on their upbringing, past experiences and ability to manage the emotions.

### What’s Next

Being able to identify emotions is a skill needed to improve our emotional intelligence. This helps us communicate in detail our emotional experiences so we can identify what to do to regulate our emotions more effectively

We can use Dr Floria Willcox (1982)’s Feeling Wheel as a starting point to identify our emotions. 

Step 1: Start from the inner centre circle of the Feeling Wheel and identify the general emotions e.g., Fearful

Step 2: Move progressively to the outer emotions e.g., Anxious > Worried

Step 3: Accept the feeling and reflect on what is causing it. 

Step 4: Recall past experiences with the same feeling and ask yourself
+ how did you manage it then
+ what works/ didn’t work as well
+ can you do that now/ what else can you do differently
+ what are the support that I have now for help

Step 5: Try out the reflected coping action.

It is not uncommon to experience a diverse combination of emotions simultaneously in a single event! Exploring deeper and be more aware of how the emotions are affecting you over long period of time allow for more specify actions that we can take. Remember, be it positive or negative emotions, they are all part of us and is needed to have a balanced life. We should not change all negative emotions into positive ones only!
